Checks for columns that should not be named according to certain patterns. 
For example, you may have a policy that no column can be named "ID",
because you want columns with complete names, such as "ORDER_ID". 
If you want to detect columns named "ID", you could use configuration as
shown in the example below.
Example configuration:
<linter id="schemacrawler.tools.linter.LinterTableWithBadlyNamedColumns">
  <config>
    <property name="bad-column-names"><![CDATA[.*\.ID]]></property>
  </config>
</linter>
