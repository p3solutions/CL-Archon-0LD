Checks for tables that have too many large objects (CLOBs or BLOBs), 
since these could result in additional reads when returning query 
results. By default, this is more than one such column.
Example configuration:
<linter id="schemacrawler.tools.linter.LinterTooManyLobs">
  <config>
    <property name="max-large-objects">3</property>
  </config>
</linter>
